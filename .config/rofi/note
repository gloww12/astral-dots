rofi doesnt symlink tooo cleanly
make sure you get the correct version of rofi btw (wayland)

symlink config.rasi to ~/.config/rofi/
symlink the colours file to ~/
symlink rofimoji to ~/.config/
symlink rofi-rbw to ~/.config/

the colours file will be stored in this directory in the dotfiles repo for cleanliness
